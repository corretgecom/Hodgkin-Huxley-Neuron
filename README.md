Hodgkin-Huxley-Neuron
=====================

This class simulates the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model by using the Runge-Kutta numerical optimization method. 

Moreover it assumes a resting potential of 0mV as described on the original paper "A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve" by Hodgkin and Huxley.
